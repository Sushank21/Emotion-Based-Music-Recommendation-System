# Music Recommendation based on Facial Emotion Recognition Android App


The Music Recommendation based on Facial Emotion Recognition Android App is an innovative application that leverages the power of facial emotion recognition to recommend music tracks that match the user's emotional state. This project integrates TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV for real-time facial emotion recognition and uses the Spotify API to access a vast library of music data for recommendations.

## Features
Real-time Emotion Detection: Utilizes TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV to analyze the user's facial expressions in real-time and determine their emotional state.

Spotify Integration: Accesses the Spotify API to retrieve music recommendations based on the detected emotion.

User Profiles: Allows users to create profiles and save their favorite tracks and emotions for personalized recommendations.

User-friendly Interface: The Android app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for a seamless experience.

## Technologies used:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
